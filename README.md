# mach/basisu - basis universal (supercompressed textures) for Zig

This repository is a separate copy of the same library in the [main Mach repository](https://github.com/hexops/mach), and is automatically kept in sync, so that anyone can use this library in their own project if they like!

## Experimental

This is an _experimental_ Mach library, according to our [stability guarantees](https://machengine.org/next/docs/libs/):

> Experimental libraries may have their APIs change without much notice, and you may have to look at recent changes in order to update your code.

[Why this library is not declared stable yet](https://machengine.org/next/docs/libs/experimental/#basisu)

## Getting started

### Adding dependency

Add mach-basisu as a dependency in your `build.zig.zon`:

```zig
.dependencies = .{
    .mach_basisu = .{
        .url = "https://github.com/hexops/mach-basisu/archive/<current commit hash>.tar.gz",
        .hash = "<get this by running zig build without the hash field>",
    },
}
```

Then in your `build.zig` add:

```zig
...
const basisu = @import("libs/mach-basisu/build.zig");

pub fn build(b: *Build) void {
    ...
    exe.addModule("basisu", b.dependency("mach_basisu", .{
        .target = target,
        .optimize = optimize,
    }).module("mach-basisu"));
    basisu.link(b, exe, .{});
}
```

## Issues

Issues are tracked in the [main Mach repository](https://github.com/hexops/mach/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abasisu).

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Pull requests must be sent to [the main repository](https://github.com/hexops/mach/tree/main/libs/basisu) to avoid some complex merge conflicts we'd get by accepting contributions in both repositories. Once the changes are merged there, they'll get sync'd to this repository automatically.
